Zylo SM App


This is NOT able to copy or modify. I and Zylo Corp* are the sole proprietors of this code and the usage of it.

Everything here is alpha, and is 100% most likely NOT to stay (or stay the way it is.)

The app contains basic functionality, containing working VC, a custom emoji system, and safe login-logout systems. However, there is NO online functionality, as of date.

I posted this as a RDMR for later.
